# Netsphere Taboola Tune Reports

This is an in-browser tool that pulls API data from Taboola, Tune ( aka HasOffers), and Netsphere. The application uses DataTables to create a table from the data and  export it to CSV and Excel.  I am using some es6 in here to test out the performance differences here as well.

## Technologies Used
* DataTables
* jQuery/JavaScript
* HasOffers
* Netsphere
* Taboola
* Tune
* Cypress
* Foundation

## To run
This is running on a private server, however, to get it set up, you would clone the repo then run `npm install` to install all the packages. After that, just go to the server locatoin or use `http-server` for a local one.  Note that the main script is eliminated out of the need of protection of private information.
